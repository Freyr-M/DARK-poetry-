            	The Realm of Frey M

In the realm of Frey, I craft the night,  
A sculptor of dreams in the cosmic light.  
My domain is a tapestry of shimmering hues,  
Where the stars and the shadows gently fuse.  
I conjure the wonders in the boundless height,  
A painter of visions, a sculptor of flight,  
A maestro of realms where fantasies ignite.

In the heart of the void, my creations arise,  
A symphony of wonders in the velvet skies.  
My artistry stretches beyond the known,  
A realm of enchantment where seeds are sown.  
With each brushstroke, a new world defies,  
In the canvas of cosmos where the mystery lies,  
A masterpiece where the boundless dreams are grown.

To traverse my realm is to journey afar,  
Through the veils of creation and the light of each star.  
An odyssey of marvels in the cosmic expanse,  
A sojourn in the splendor of a timeless dance.  
In the dominion of Frey, where mysteries spar,  
A legend unfolds beneath the cosmic scar,  
A story of wonder that transcends the bizarre.

               IN THE NAME WE SHARE 
In love's tender arms, my spirit took flight,
Where laughter dances in the soft twilight.
With every heartbeat, the world feels so right,
Boundless affection, an eternal delight.

Through valleys of dreams, where stars ignite,
Our souls entwined, two hearts alight,
In your embrace, all worries take flight,
Love's pure essence, an endless height.

In whispers of breeze, our tale takes flight,
Eternal devotion, an unending sight,
In your eyes, a universe so bright,
Guided by love, through day and night

May the tears she cried over him drown her,
And let the echoes of her bad mouthing deafen her.
All the negative thoughts she harbored about him,
Drive her mind to realms unknown, a whirlwind grim.

As she runs into another's arms, may fate find her,
Breaking legs, stumbling in her hasty blur.
Each lie she told him, now gospel truth to his ear,

A heart once shattered, let it be a distant fear.

A serpent, the least to describe her in this sad song,
Slithering through his thoughts, where she doesn't belong.
Coiled in his mind, blinding his sight so keen,
Your slithering presence, a venomous sheen.

Murmuring and flapping lips of deceit's hue,
Masking lust with words that seem true.

No curse to cast, just a light to shine,
On sins that match, in this twisted design.

Love, a lie spun to fulfill her whims,
Vanished without a trace, when the need brims.
Abandoned in knots, without a goodbye note,
Karma's ledger, I hope it did denote.

Knocking soon, as fate dictates the score,
Just as she left, let it stay forevermore. 


May she learn from the ache she caused,
In the broken pieces, her remorse be paused.
For every wound inflicted, a lesson to impart,
To awaken empathy, within her heart's chart.

And as time unfolds its mysterious art,
May she find redemption, a brand-new start.
Let karma's echo resonate, a gentle knock,
Teaching her humility, in life's intricate clock.

Rushing not, yet set in stride,
Bearing burdens, no time to bide,
Life's currents pull and sway,
Still, an unwavering smile holds sway,
So ordinary, in an extraordinary way.

Slumbering past the hour's chime,
Rise in haste, no wasted time,
Avoiding lateness, a daily quest,
Fear of locked gates, an unwelcome guest,
Extra hours to amend the day's crime,
Homeward bound, yet smiles align,
No fret, no hurry,
So ordinary.

Delays in pay, a dreaded scene,
Check procedures, a long routine,
Bills persist, a constant theme,
Still smiling, swallowing disappointment's sheen,
Late returns, nights routine,
Late to bed, early to glean,
Rushed to work in a flurried blur,
So ordinary, yet enduring.

Payday arrives, feels heaven-sent,
Forgetting the toils, so content,
Check on the right, bills on the left,
Numbers jumble, a mind-bending theft,
Salary versus bills, a mismatch evident,
Consider an advance, life's bent.

Slumbering late, rising with the sun,
Work-bound in haste, day's duties begun,
Leaving late, wearing that familiar grin,
So ordinary, yet finding joy within.

Last night,  
I couldn't sleep;  
I kept turning  
and thinking  
how calm and warming  
your touch felt  
on my skin  
beneath the sheets.

I wanted to cry,  
but my pillow was already soaked,  
and I couldn't shake off the shock  
that you are not coming back.  
I really tried to cry,  
but instead, I started to draw  
your image  
to ease the imagination.

I traced all the scars  
and all the curves,  
missing and admiring what I will never have.  
It felt awful  
roaming through the night like an owl,  
like a lost soul.

The home  
that you kept warm  
is now just a house,  
cold and silent  
without your presence.  
The past is making more sense  
because the present,  
without your presence,  
is more than absent.

*P.S.: What we had was real,  
but I guess good things don't last forever.*  
*That's why I'm binding you this farewell.*

                Am I overdoing or is this your new way of luring?
I've been keenly analyzing,
Reading between the lines,
Trying all I can to see us as an item,
Swallowing pangs of pain,
Putting up with your unbecoming.
The way you relate to me is toxic,
And comparing it to how we started, it's shocking.

Was it a joke or were you tired after work,
When you said, "I need actions, not just words"?
Attention, caring, speaking your love language,
And loving you as if we just met,
Pure intimacy opening up, no secrets as if we just wed.
What is it that you're holding and not sharing?
What's stopping you from caring?

This is me pouring my heart out,
Hoping together we'll work it out.
Don't fight it alone,
Come lean on my shoulder,
Open up,
Shed some light on what's darkening your heart,
Ignite flames of love.
It's cold to have you in my arms while your mind's at millions of miles,
Faking smiles,
Pretending not to feel guilt.

Love is the union and fusion of emotions and feelings,
With synchronized heartbeats,
Let's find our rhythm, our sync,
In this dance of love, let's never sink.

Reveal what's hidden beneath your veiled eyes,
Let our love break through all the lies.
It's not just a facade, not a mere show,
Let the authenticity of our bond glow.
Together we'll mend what's torn apart,
Resurrect love from its dormant heart.

Trust in us, let it rise from the debris,
Reignite the passion that once set us free.
Embrace the truth, discard the disguise,
Let our love bloom, reaching for the skies.
In our union, let's find our peace,
Love's harmony, let it never cease.

In the dawn’s tender light, a whisper begins,
A call to the youth, where hope never dims.
Through the streets they march, with voices so clear,
Challenging the old, confronting their fear.
Their banners aloft, with dreams intertwined,
Seeking a future, by justice defined.
In unity’s embrace, they find their stride,
With hearts full of fire, and eyes open wide.
Together they rise, for the world they design.

Amidst the turmoil, their courage remains,
Each step they take, breaking invisible chains.
Voices like rivers, they flow and they roar,
Demanding the end of an unjust war.
For equity’s promise, they stand tall and strong,
Righting the history of what has been wrong.
In the echo of chants, a nation reborn,
From the shadows of dusk to the light of morn.
In their hands, they hold tomorrow’s dawn.

Under the sun's gaze, their spirits ignite,
With a fervor that turns darkness to light.
In the realm of ideals, they plant their seeds,
Watered by action, not just by creeds.
Every challenge faced, they boldly confront,
With truth as their shield and love as their front.
Braving the storms, they carve out new paths,
In the face of despair, they break into laughs.
Their journey of change, an unending quest.

In the twilight's calm, their story is told,
Of the young and the brave, defying the old.
Their legacy written in hearts and in minds,
A testament to the power that binds.
For in every soul, a spark can be found,
A beacon of hope, profoundly unbound.
Together they march, as history’s guides,
With unwavering faith, where justice resides.
In unity’s song, the future abides.

                Heart's Anguis  by FREY MURIGI 
Heart Anguish. 
I wanted you so much,  
And when you realized, saw yourself in my eyes,  
From my point of view, you were an angel.  
But you started to cut me off from all angles,  
As if taking an L was not enough.  
You dragged my emotions, played rough with my feelings,  
Hurting was not your concern.  
You put me in a corner,  
Pouring out your cold heart just to hurt.


You knew it was you I was after,  
Even with your prolonged laughter.  
Whenever I mentioned my heart matters,  
You still were the one I was falling for.  
Your indifference cut deep, left scars,  
Making me question what we were.  
Yet I remained, hoping for change,  
Despite the pain you caused,  
Yearning for a love that never came.

Every cold word, every harsh tone,  
Only solidified the walls you'd grown.  
You showed no care for the tears I shed,  
Breaking me down with each word said.  
Still, I held on, to the dream of us,  
Ignoring the reality, avoiding the fuss.  
In my heart, you were always near,  
Despite the truth, despite the fear,  
I longed for the love you couldn’t give.

Now I see, clear as day,  
Your love was never meant to stay.  
The pain you caused has set me free,  
From the chains of a love that could never be.  
I'll mend my heart, find my peace,  
Let the anguish of loving you cease.  
For in the end, I learned to see,  
That the love I needed was within me.  
And in letting go, I found my harmony.

I aim high, looking up to short-term goals,  
And you aren't one, my girl.  
Why drag myself behind with lies  
When free of strings, I can fly?  
I accept you are a vibe I feel,  
But I will always choose the deals.  
That is my brain's anatomy.  
I said no to knots; I fear alimony.  
My future calls, and I must heed.

The journey ahead is mine alone,  
To conquer peaks I've never known.  
No tethered dreams to weigh me down,  
In the skies, I seek my crown.  
Your presence, though a lovely spark,  
Can't hold me back from leaving a mark.  
I stride with purpose, bold and free,  
Building a path that's meant for me.  
With every step, I shape my creed.

To chase the sun and touch the stars,  
Requires a heart that's free of bars.  
No chains to hold, no ties that bind,  
A liberated state of mind.  
I'll cherish memories we made,  
But won't let our past invade.  
The freedom to explore my way,  
Is something I can't betray.  
I forge ahead, my spirit lead.

In solitude, my strength is found,  
With every leap, I'm glory-bound.  
Ambitions drive me, fierce and true,  
To paint my skies with a brighter hue.  
Your laughter, a melody in the past,  
But my destiny is cast.  
I thank you for the times we shared,  
Yet now, my soul is unprepared.  
To stay, I'd lose my dreams anew.
